# Connenslate

## (conn)ect+tran(slate)=ConnenSlate
ConnenSlate connects on-call interpreters with refugees, immigrants, and newcomers in Canada for better accessing essential services in their own language. The core features of our app consider two types of users, User A for the interpreter, and User B for the newcomer. User A can receive interpretation requests, access a calendar with appointments and/or specify available hours, and can Join a call/chat with a user. User B can sends/or schedules an interpretation request, can specify the needed area of interpretation, and the appâ€™s language is set in their native language they select. The general features of the app include an onboarding assessment for better matching services, support Audio/ Video/ Texting interpretation for accessibility inclusion, and Include a rating/and reviews system.
